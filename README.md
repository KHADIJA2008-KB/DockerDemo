> IMDB Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis <

What's This Project About?
This project is all about figuring out if movie reviews from IMDB are positive or negative. We use a dataset of 50,000 reviews and a machine learning model called Logistic Regression. To make the text understandable for the model, we clean it up using techniques like TF-IDF (to turn words into numbers), tokenization (breaking text into words), removing common words (like "the" or "and"), and lemmatization (simplifying words to their base form) with tools like NLTK and spaCy.

What Does It Do?
1.Takes movie reviews and predicts if they’re positive or negative.
2.Cleans up text data to make it easier for the model to understand.
3.Uses a Logistic Regression model to classify reviews.
4.Shows how well the model performs with metrics like accuracy.

What You Need
1.Python (version 3.8 or higher)
2.Libraries: nltk, spacy, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
3.A spaCy model called en_core_web_sm (you’ll install this later)

How to Set It Up
1.Grab the project files:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>

2.Install the needed libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Get the spaCy model:
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

How to Run It
1.Make sure you have the IMDB dataset file (IMDB_Dataset.csv) in the project folder.
2.Run the script:python sentiment_analysis.py
3.The script will:
- Clean up the reviews (tokenize, remove stop words, lemmatize)
- Train the Logistic Regression model
- Show you how well it did with metrics like accuracy, precision, etc.

What's in the Project?
1.sentiment_analysis.py: The main code that does all the work
2.IMDB_Dataset.csv: The dataset (you can get it from Kaggle)
3.requirements.txt: List of libraries you need
4.README.md: This file!

What Results Can You Expect?
- The model usually gets around 85% accuracy (pretty good!).
- You’ll see detailed results like precision, recall, and F1-score when you run the script.

Ideas for Making It Better
1.Try fancier models like LSTM or BERT.
2.Tweak the model settings to make it even better.
3.Add a way to predict sentiments for new reviews on the fly.
